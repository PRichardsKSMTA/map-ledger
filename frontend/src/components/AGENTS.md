# Component Guidelines

Reusable React components live here.

- Ensure accessibility: keyboard navigation, proper ARIA roles, and high-contrast support【F:MapLedger Runbook 3.html†L840-L842】.
- Use functional components and React hooks.
- Provide tests using Jest and React Testing Library. Refer to runbook examples for UploadForm, MappingPage, COATemplateEditor, BenchmarkDashboard, and AuthContext【F:MapLedger Runbook 3.html†L1398-L1432】.
- Mock Axios and MSAL modules in tests when needed【F:MapLedger Runbook 3.html†L1392-L1396】.
